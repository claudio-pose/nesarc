# nesarc

This code can be used to anaylse the dataset provided by the U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). It consists of a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population 18 years and older. The participants were also asked questions related to gambling.

# How to
1. Setting up analysis/analysis.py
- Set the variable dataset_path so it points to the NESARC CSV file
2. Run analysis.py, since the entire dataset will be loaded into the computer's memory, this might take a couple of minutes.
